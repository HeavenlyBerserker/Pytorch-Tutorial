# Pytorch-Tutorial
Created by Hong Xu for University of Utah's Machine Learning class Spring 2020.

The structure of the tutorial is as follows
* **Powerpoint first covers**
  * *Frameworks Overview: why pytorch?* which gives a brief overview of the frameworks and their history.
  * *Pytorch: Installation and running* which is a quick installation guide.
* **We move to a Jupyter Notebook** to explain and run some code
  * *Pytorch: building blocks*
  * *Pytorch: optimizer, scheduler and data loader*
  * *Pytorch: MNIST step-by-step example*
* **We return to the Powerpoint** to explore some visualization tools and look/compare with some Tensorflow code
  * *Pytorch: Ideal project structure* 
  * *Other resources* Visualization and more
  * *Tensorflow briefly: MNIST example*
